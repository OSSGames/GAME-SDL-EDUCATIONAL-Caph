	1. DESCRIPTION

It is a sandbox game, based on physics. The game aim is to make contact red
object with green object. You can use various objects, solid, wire (rope), and
bendable objects. Gravitation will help you.


	2. ABSTRACT

The red circle misses his green friend. And the only one who can help them to
be together again is you. ^_^ With one flick of your mouse you can draw him a
rope ('S' button), a  metal stick ('A'), or a wire, made from some soft metal
('B'), or take them away from him, one by one ('D'). You can even stop the time
('T') and give him a break while you'll rethink your actions or draw something
so complicated, that you won't be able to finish it with only one line. And
when you'll think that you have to take a break yourself, you can leave this
guy for a moment ('Q') and return to the boring "real" world.
